          In 2016, fresh off completing my Master&#39;s in Computer Science, I
          embarked on a journey to explore web development by creating a custom
          static website. Little did I know, this venture would plunge me deep
          into the captivating world of coding and web development. Fast-forward
          to the present day, and I&#39;ve had the honor of crafting software
          solutions for diverse clients, including an e-commerce giant, a
          prominent multinational banking corporation, and several other
          innovative MVPs. My true passion lies at the intersection of design
          and engineering, where I relish in crafting software that not only
          boasts aesthetic appeal but also operates flawlessly beneath the
          surface.

          From November 2022 I intentionally took a hiatus from my professional
          career to navigate a significant life transition. This break allowed
          me the opportunity to focus on personal growth, family commitments,
          and other aspects of my life. Despite not being formally employed
          during this time, I remained proactive in honing my skills,
          particularly in React, by staying updated with the latest industry
          trends and developments. Now, as I prepare to re-enter the workforce,
          I am eager to bring forth my renewed dedication, enthusiasm, and a
          wealth of experiences that have shaped me both personally and
          professionally.

          When I&#39;m not immersed in code, you can often find me exploring the
          vibrant streets of NYC, camera in hand, capturing moments of life and
          architecture. I have a penchant for savoring a good cup of coffee
          while delving into the city&#39;s myriad cultural offerings.
          Additionally, I&#39;m an avid enthusiast of outdoor activities, always
          eager to embrace new adventures and experiences in nature.
